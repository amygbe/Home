# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Amy! I am a data scientist who is a big fan of predictive modeling and data viz. I currently work mainly in python to build podium probabilities and other interesting predictions for Canadian Olympic teams! I'm also learning a lot about Bayesian stats by taking Richard McElreath's course "Statistical Rethinking" and exploring some deep learning with Andrew Ng's online courses. 

Check out my [posts page](https://www.amybell.info/posts/) to see what I've been working on!

Apart from my professional pursuits, I am also a competitive cyclist, avid hiker, professional cat petter, and scifi/fantasy novel reader!
