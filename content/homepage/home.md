# Hi, I'm Amy!

I'm a data scientist who is a big fan of predictive modeling and data viz. I currently work mainly in Python to build podium probabilities and other interesting predictions for Canadian Olympic teams! I'm also learning a lot about Bayesian stats by taking Richard McElreath's course "Statistical Rethinking" in R and exploring some deep learning with Andrew Ng's Coursera courses.
