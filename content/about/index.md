# Hi, I'm Amy!

I'm a data scientist who is a big fan of predictive modeling and data viz. I currently work mainly in Python to build podium probabilities and other interesting predictions for Canadian Olympic teams! I'm also learning a lot about Bayesian stats by taking Richard McElreath's course "Statistical Rethinking" in R and exploring some deep learning with Andrew Ng's Coursera courses. 

Check out my [posts page](https://www.amybell.info/posts/) to see what I've been working on!

### Bike Stuff
I've been into bike racing since 2013 and have won a few races over the years!
- 4x Canadian National champion ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- 13x Ontario provincial champion 
- 12x National medals
- 24x Provincial medals

These days, I spend a lot of time lifting, xc skiing, biathlon shooting, climbing, and learning new skills (most recently and notable: handstand walks and muscle ups)
<--->
