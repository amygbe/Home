# More About Me

### Bike Stuff
I've been into bike racing since 2013 and have won a few races over the years!
- 4x Canadian National champion ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
- 13x Ontario provincial champion 
- 12x National medals
- 24x Provincial medals

These days, I spend a lot of time lifting, xc skiing, biathlon shooting, climbing, and learning new skills (most recently and notable: handstand walks and muscle ups)

## Videogames
This is **not** an exhaustive tier list but it still highlights some of my all time favourite games! I've only added tier S and A because realistically who cares about games I don't love.
